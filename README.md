# MyToDoApp
A simple iOS To-Do app that I created to get started with iOS development and MVVM architecture model.


📚 Features:

✏️ Create and delete tasks and specify priority level and due dates

✏️ Dynamic views that highlight tasks with high priority, tasks due in less than a day, and/or tasks that are overdue
